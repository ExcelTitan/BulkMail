## Template Body Types
You can draft a template email to send to all recipients in either Text or HTML formatting.

*Text:* sends emails using just plain text characters. All email applications support plain text. This format is great if you do not depend on any fancy formatting, and it ensures maximum compatibility. Everybody who has an email account will be able to read your message. Plain text doesn't support bold, italic, colored fonts, or other text formatting. It also doesn't support pictures that are displayed directly in the message body, although you can include the pictures as attachments.   
If you select the Text format you can only choose a txt file for the body template and for the signature. You cannot select a range from Excel to include in your email as these require HTML formatting.

*Html:* the default message format in Outlook. It is also the best format to use when you want to create messages that are similar to traditional documents, with various fonts, colors, and bullet lists. You can make text stand out with italics, for example, or change the font. You can even include pictures and charts that will display inline and use other formatting tools to make your messages prettier and easier to read.  
You can draft a document with images and charts and save as an html file for the body of your email.  
With choosing HTML formatting you can insert either htm, html or txt files for the body and the signature. Just remember that the file type of the body should match the file type of the signature. 

## What Excel Versions is it compatible with?
This is tested on Windows 8 and Windows 10 using Excel Versions 2010, 2013 and 2016. This may still be usable for 2007 but it is untested at this stage.
